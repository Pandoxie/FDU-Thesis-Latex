	Abstract = {Quantum information protocols utilizing atomic ensembles require preparation of a coherent spin state (CSS) of the ensemble as an important starting point. We investigate the magneto-optical resonance method for characterizing a spin state of caesium atoms in a paraffin coated vapour cell. Atoms in a constant magnetic field are subject to an off-resonant laser beam and an RF magnetic field. The spectrum of the Zeeman sub-levels, in particular the weak quadratic Zeeman effect, enables us to measure the spin orientation, the number of atoms, and the transverse spin coherence time. Notably the use of 894 nm pumping light on the D1 line, ensuring the state F = 4, m F = 4 is a dark state, helps us to achieve spin orientation of better than 98%. Hence we can establish a CSS with high accuracy, which is critical for the analysis of the entangled states of atoms.},

	Abstract = {We use evanescent waves in a counterpropagating beams configuration to study the adsorption/desorption processes at a Cs vapor/dielectric interface in a sealed cell. Atoms close to the surface are velocity-selectively spin-polarized before adsorption by an amplitude-modulated pump beam. We subsequently observe the contribution of the desorbed atoms to the probe-beam absorption by way of phase-sensitive detection. We measure the number of desorbing polarized Cs atoms as a function of the surface temperature. The analysis of results is done through a simple thermodynamical model for the atomic desorption and we discuss its validity to infer the adsorption energy of the cesium atoms on a fused-quartz surface.},

@article{Ritter473,
	Abstract = {Radio-frequency magnetic resonances have been studied between the states of the atomic level 5 $^{2}$P$_{\frac{3}{2}}$, excited in a coarse atomic beam of potassium by optical resonance radiation. The resonances were detected by observing changes in the intensity of the scattered resonance radiation. Hyperfine structure was observed in the Paschen-Back region, and in magnetic fields down to zero. Values of a and b, the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interaction constants, derived independently from measurements in the strong and zero field regions, are in agreement. The values a = 1$\cdot $97 $\pm $ 0$\cdot $1 Mc/s, b = 1$\cdot $7 $\pm $0$\cdot $3 Mc/s have been obtained for the interaction constants of $^{39}$K. Double quantum transitions between hyperfine structure levels were observed in zero field. The nuclear magnetic moment derived from a agrees with molecular beam magnetic resonance measurements; the nuclear electric quadrupole moment derived from b is 0$\cdot $11$_{3}\pm $0$\cdot $02$\times $10$^{-24}$ cm$^{2}$. Hyperfine structure was also observed in the level 5 $^{2}$P$_{\frac{1}{2}}$. A preliminary value for the a factor is 9$\cdot $3$\pm $0$\cdot $5 Mc/s.},

	Abstract = {Some of the most sensitive methods of measuring magnetic fields use interactions of resonant light with atomic vapour. Recent developments in this vibrant field have led to improvements in sensitivity and other characteristics of atomic magnetometers, benefiting their traditional applications for measurements of geomagnetic anomalies and magnetic fields in space, and opening many new areas previously accessible only to magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices. We review basic principles of modern optical magnetometers, discuss fundamental limitations on their performance, and describe recently explored applications for dynamical measurements of biomagnetic fields, detecting signals in NMR and MRI, inertial rotation sensing, magnetic microscopy with cold atoms, and tests of fundamental symmetries of nature.},
